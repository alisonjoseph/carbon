# Figma Code Connect for @carbon/react

> [!WARNING]  
> Figma [Code Connect](https://github.com/figma/code-connect) is currently in
> beta and integration with Carbon React is in an exploratory phase.

Code Connect offers a solution for linking the
[Carbon v11 All themes](https://carbondesignsystem.com/designing/kits/figma/)
Figma library components directly to their counterparts inside of @carbon/react.
By incorporating Code Connect into your workflow, Figma's Dev Mode will showcase
authentic code snippets derived from your Carbon React design system, bypassing
generic examples.

Not only does Code Connect establish connections between component definitions,
but it also facilitates the mapping of properties from Carbon React code to
Figma. This capability enables the creation of dynamic and accurate examples,
promoting consistentcy across both design and engineering.
